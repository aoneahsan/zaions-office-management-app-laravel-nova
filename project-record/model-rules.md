- model name should not be plural.
  - mean "ApiKeys" is wrong
  - it should be "ApiKey"
  - ask if needed
- in each model, if you add any relation of any type, make sure to properly add it's columns names in the relation function.
  - e.g:
    - instead of writing
      - return $this->belongsTo(Board::class);
    - write
      - return $this->belongsTo(Board::class, 'boardId', 'id');
